# Repository with small projects I played around with
- [Phase diagram of Bose-Hubbard model using exact diagonalization](https://github.com/kpatucha/Playground/blob/main/notebooks/BH_phase_diagram.ipynb) - exact diagonalization implemented using OOP and some neat tricks to calculate phase boundary
- [Exact diagonalization of Bose-Hubbard model](https://github.com/kpatucha/Playground/blob/main/notebooks/BH_exact_diag.ipynb) - using `cupy` and GPU
- [Mutual information for mixed random variables](https://github.com/kpatucha/Playground/blob/main/notebooks/mutual_information.ipynb) - can also be used for features with missing values
- [Kullback-leibler divergence from epirical CDF](https://github.com/kpatucha/Playground/blob/main/notebooks/kl-divergence.ipynb) - compared to other estimator
