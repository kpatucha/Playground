    "\n",
    "Combination can also be done with numerical splits which can be interpreted binary categorical variable e.g. `feature_4 > 3.5` $\\Rightarrow$ `0` or `1`, which later is combined with categorical feature e.g. `feature_5=\"red|1\"` (again - we will see how it is done exactly later).\n",
